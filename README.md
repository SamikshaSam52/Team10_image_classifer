#  Evaluate on Test Set

This repository demonstrates how to evaluate a trained machine learning model on a *test dataset, a critical step in model validation. This project is developed as part of a **Source Code Management (SCM)* academic assignment.

---

##  Project Overview

In any ML pipeline, evaluating a model on an unseen test set helps determine its *generalization capability*. This project focuses on:

Loading a trained model.
Preparing and loading the test dataset.
Evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
Visualizing the results.
Demonstrating Git-based source code tracking.

##  Tech Stack

*Language*: Python
*Libraries*:
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
